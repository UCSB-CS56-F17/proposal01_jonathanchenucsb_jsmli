Proposal for New Legacy Code Project - Jonathan C. and Jackson L.

A mobile Android video game based on the existing iOS game: "Slingy Ball". 

Slingy Ball is a physics-based platform game. The player controls a ball, and their objective is to climb upwards by landing on platforms. The player moves the ball by making "shots". You can see how the shot mechanic works in this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHGi1dEkDo0&t=90s 
The player drags their finger on the "control pad ball" on the bottom of the screen.
When a player lands on a platform, they earn a point, and the next platform will lower on to the screen. 

Implementing the gameplay of the game will be the hardest challenge of the game. Neither Jonathan nor Jackson has worked with Android apps in the past, so learning the Android Studio IDE, and working with the native graphic libraries will also be a challenge. The physics will not be implemented with a 3rd party library or game engine. We will try to write our own physics by writing in the basic kinematic equations, and using a timer object for those equations. If the proposee (you) believes that it is okay to use some basic animation/physics libraries that come with the game, we may consider using those. The physics in this Android version may not excactly replicate the physics in the iOS version.

Jonathan created the original Slingy Ball on iOS. Although Jonathan implemented the physics of the iOS version, he was heavily dependent on some native iOS physics libaries for gravity and collisions (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidynamicanimator). Also, the native graphic libraries in iOS and Android will be different.
For Jonathan, this project will not simply be a copy and paste assignment.
